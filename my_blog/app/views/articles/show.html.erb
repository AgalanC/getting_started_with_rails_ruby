<%# 

The code below the "data" option is used to set the "data-turbo-method" and "data-turbo-confirm" HTML attributes of the "Destroy" link. Both of these attributes hook into "Turbo", which is included by default in "fresh" Rails applications.

The 'data-turbo-method="delete"' will cause the link to make a "DELETE" request instead of a "GET" request. The 'data-turbo-confirm="Are you sure?"' will cause a "confirmation dialog" to appear when the link is clicked. If the user cancels the "dialog", the request will be aborted.
